# DentalHub Netlify Deployment Update

## Import Path Resolution Fix

We've identified and resolved a critical issue with the import paths in our Netlify Functions. The problem was that functions in different directory levels were using inconsistent import paths for the `response-helpers.js` utility:

- Functions in the root directory (`netlify/functions/`) need to use: `require('./utils/response-helpers')`
- Functions in subdirectories (`netlify/functions/dashboard/`) need to use: `require('../utils/response-helpers')`

### Solution Implemented

1. Created a specialized script (`scripts/fix-netlify-imports.js`) that:
   - Scans all Netlify Functions recursively
   - Determines the correct import path based on file location
   - Updates the import statements accordingly

2. Fixed 34 files with incorrect import paths, ensuring:
   - Root-level functions use `./utils/response-helpers`
   - Subdirectory functions use `../utils/response-helpers`

## Deployment Process

To ensure successful deployment to Netlify, follow these steps:

1. **Pre-deployment Check**
   ```bash
   # Run the import path fix script
   node scripts/fix-netlify-imports.js
   
   # Verify functions locally
   netlify functions:serve
   ```

2. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify Functions import paths for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Preview**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:preview
   ```

4. **Deploy to Production** (after testing preview)
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Path Resolution Errors

If you see errors like `Could not resolve "../utils/response-helpers"` during build:

1. Run the fix script again: `node scripts/fix-netlify-imports.js`
2. Check if any new functions were added that might need path correction
3. Verify the `response-helpers.js` file exists in `netlify/functions/utils/`

### Function Timeout Errors

For functions that process large amounts of data:

1. Update the timeout in `netlify.toml`:
   ```toml
   [functions]
     timeout = 30
   ```

2. For specific functions needing more time:
   ```toml
   [functions.large-data-processor]
     timeout = 60
   ```

## Testing Deployed Functions

After deployment, test the functions using:

```
https://dentalhub-v10.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/hello-world
https://dentalhub-v10.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/health-check
```

## Monitoring and Logs

Monitor function performance and errors through:
- Netlify Dashboard > Functions
- Netlify Dashboard > Deploys > Deploy Log
- Function-specific logs via `netlify functions:invoke`
