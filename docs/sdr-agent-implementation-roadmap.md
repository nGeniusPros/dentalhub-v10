# SDR Agent Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document provides a roadmap for transitioning from the architectural design phase to the implementation phase for the SDR (Sales Development Representative) agent feature. The SDR agent will implement dental practice campaign automations to drive prospects toward booking appointments using the business logic provided.

## Documents Created

1. **Implementation Plan** (`docs/sdr-agent-implementation-plan.md`) - Provides an overview of the feature and outlines the implementation steps.

2. **Technical Specification** (`docs/sdr-agent-technical-specification.md`) - Offers detailed class structures, interfaces, and integration guidance.

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Campaign Logic (Week 1)

1. Create the directory structure for the SDR agent
2. Implement the base Campaign class
3. Implement the specialized campaign classes (e.g., LeadGenerationCampaign, NoResponseCampaign)
4. Implement the CampaignManager class
5. Add TypeScript interfaces and types
6. Create unit tests for the core logic

### Phase 2: Agent Integration (Week 2)

1. Implement the SDRAgent class
2. Integrate with communication services (SMS, email, voice)
3. Connect to database for prospect and campaign data
4. Implement event scheduling mechanism
5. Add logging and monitoring
6. Test integrations

### Phase 3: User Interface and Controls (Week 3)

1. Create UI components for campaign management
2. Implement dashboard for campaign performance
3. Add prospect management screens
4. Create campaign configuration interface
5. Test UI components

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (Week 4)

1. Perform integration testing
2. Conduct performance testing with large prospect datasets
3. Implement analytics tracking
4. Optimize message personalization
5. Address any bugs or issues
6. Document the implementation

## Transition to Code Mode

To begin implementation, switch to Code mode and follow these steps:

1. Create the directory structure:
   ```
   src/ai/sdr/
   ├── campaigns/
   ├── interfaces/
   ├── sdr.agent.ts
   └── campaign-manager.ts
   ```

2. Implement the base Campaign class and interfaces first
3. Add one campaign type (e.g., LeadGenerationCampaign) to test the structure
4. Validate with unit tests before proceeding to additional campaign types

## Potential Challenges

1. **Message Scheduling** - Implementing an efficient scheduling system for timed messages may require a robust background job processor.

2. **State Management** - Keeping track of prospect state across multiple campaigns will need careful database design.

3. **Integration Complexity** - The SDR agent needs to interact with multiple services (SMS, email, voice), which may have different APIs and requirements.

4. **Performance at Scale** - The system needs to handle thousands of prospects across multiple campaigns efficiently.

5. **Testing Complexity** - Testing the time-based aspects of campaigns may require mocking time or other advanced testing strategies.

## Integration Points

The SDR agent will need to integrate with the following existing systems:

1. **Communication Service** (`src/lib/api/communicationService.ts`):
   - SMS API for text messages
   - Voice API for phone calls
   - Retell API for AI voice interactions

2. **Database** - For storing prospect and campaign data

3. **Head Brain Consultant** - Potentially integrate with the orchestrator system if needed

4. **User Interface** - Create new UI components for campaign management

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each campaign type in isolation
   - Verify message personalization
   - Test response handling logic

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test communication service integration
   - Verify database operations
   - Test time-based scheduling

3. **UI Tests**:
   - Verify campaign management UI
   - Test prospect management screens

4. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Simulate complete prospect journeys through campaigns
   - Test the full system with actual communication services (in a test environment)

## Next Steps

1. Review the implementation plan and technical specification with the development team
2. Obtain stakeholder sign-off on the approach
3. Switch to Code mode to begin implementation
4. Start with the core campaign classes and build out from there
5. Hold regular reviews to ensure alignment with the architectural vision

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All campaign types have been implemented according to the business logic
2. The system can manage prospects across multiple campaigns
3. Messages are properly personalized and sent on schedule
4. The UI allows for campaign management and monitoring
5. Performance testing confirms the system can handle the expected load
6. All tests pass, including edge cases

## Conclusion

The SDR agent represents a significant enhancement to the DentalHub platform's marketing automation capabilities. By following this roadmap, the development team can transition smoothly from architecture to implementation, resulting in a robust feature that helps dental practices nurture leads and convert prospects into appointments.
